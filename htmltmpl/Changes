        - bugfix in easydoc: hidden classes were not hidden

    1.15 : 2001/09/01
        - !! This release is a major redesign of the module.
             It's incompatible with code using the old interface.
             I tried to make the old interface as similar to HTML::Template
             as possible, but it apparently was not a good idea, because
             design of HTML::Template is not much object oriented.
             It would be a major pain to implement that in Java.
             So, please check the documentation for description of the
             new much more flexible interface. !!
           
        - The module is now multitask safe on UNIX and Windows
          platforms (precompiled '.tmplc' files are now properly locked).
          On Macintosh the locking is not implemented and precompilation
          is disabled on that platform. Anyone willing to implement the 
          file locking on Mac ?

        - Corrupted or incompatible .tmplc files are now transparently
          detected, removed and recreated.

        - Templates are now recompiled, if the precompiled form was compiled
          with different 'include', 'max_include' or 'comments' settings.

        - Templates now can be compiled also from strings.

        - Test suite enhancements.

    1.14 : 2001/08/26
        - documentation updates

    1.13 : 2001/08/26
        - documentation updates & spellchecking
        - new examples in 'doc'
        - some pyChecker cleanups

    1.10 : 2001/08/25
        
        - !! Please note that you must delete all your old compiled 
             templates (.tmplc files) before you upgrade to this version.
             This version introduces a new format of .tmplc files which is
             not compatible with the old one. !!

        - !! Exceptions TmplEx and FatalEx were removed. New exception
             TemplateError replaces them both. !!
        
        - FIXED: self._include_files list was not reset when the template
                 has changed on the disk and was recompiled
        - FIXED: invocation of os.stat() on an included template which
                 may be no longer accessible
        - new optimization: see merge_statements()
        - unrecognized TMPL_* statements are now detected and TemplateError
          is raised if one is found (it's more compatible with HTML::Template)
        - unrecognized magic variables are now detected and TemplateError is
          raised when one is found
        - better exception handling
        - OO design polishing => moved template metadata to a new separate 
          Metadata class
        - the new .tmplc format is much more extensible
        - some code was replaced with library functions from os.path
        - some variables and methods now have more descriptive names
        - documentation enhancements
        - added this Changes file
        - general code polishing

    1.00 : 2001/08/15
