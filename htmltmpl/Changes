        - !! Please note that you must delete all your old compiled 
             templates (.tmplc files) before you upgrade to this version.
             This version introduces a new format of .tmplc files which is
             not compatible with the old one. !!

        - !! Exceptions TmplEx and FatalEx were removed. New exception
             TemplateError replaces them both. !!
        
        - FIXED: self._include_files list was not reset when the template
                 has changed on the disk and was recompiled
        - FIXED: invocation of os.stat() on an included template which
                 may be no longer accessible
        - new optimization: see merge_statements()
        - unrecognized TMPL_* statements are now detected and TemplateError
          is raised if one is found (it's more compatible with HTML::Template)
        - unrecognized magic variables are now detected and TemplateError is
          raised when one is found
        - better exception handling
        - OO design polishing => moved template metadata to a new separate 
          Metadata class
        - the new .tmplc format is much more extensible
        - some code was replaced with library functions from os.path
        - some variables and methods now have more descriptive names
        - documentation enhancements
        - added this Changes file
        - general code polishing
