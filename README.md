# htmltmpl

Original source: http://htmltmpl.sourceforge.net/

This version is cloned from CVS to Git and updated to support Python3.

If you're writing new code, there are probably much better templating engines - this is largely useful for converting Perl codebases using HTML::Template to Python3.
