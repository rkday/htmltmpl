    ========

    A PHP based templating engine for separation of code and HTML.
      
    To run the regression tests (recommended):
    
        Make sure your PHP CGI executable is in PATH and then execute:
    
        perl test.pl
    

    To use the module copy the file 'htmltmpl.php' to some place
    readable by your scripts and put the following line to the top of them:

        require('htmltmpl.php');
