        - NEW: HTML <form> control directives:

                <TMPL_TEXT>
                <TMPL_SELECT>
                <TMPL_RADIO>
                <TMPL_CHECKBOX>
                <TMPL_CUSTSELECT>
                <TMPL_CUSTRADIO>
                <TMPL_CUSTCHECKBOX>
                <TMPL_OPTION>

            They make easier and automate some very common form related
            tasks, but still do not enforce any cumbersome huge framework
            on the developer.
              

        - NEW: New better interface for association of values with loops.
               Now you can code like this:

                $tp = new TemplateProcessor();

                $users = $tp->loop("Users", "name", "age", "Friends");
                while (list($name, $age) = something()) {
                    $friends = $tp->loop("Friends", "name");
                    $friends->push(get_friend());
                    $users->push($name, $age, $friends);
                }
                $users->commit();
                
                No more you need to create all those impractical temporary
                arrays. This is also more memory efficient.


        - NEW: Optimization of redundant spaces. The template engine now can
               remove redundant spaces from the beginnings of lines. Using this
               technique the templates can be written in readable manner
               without any inconveniencies for users on slow network
               connections.  Removal of redundant spaces usually results in
               30-50% decrease in size of the page. This feature may be
               activated by using the new 'optimize_spaces' parameter of the
               TemplateManager constructor.  One must take care to not use this
               feature on templates which make use of the <pre> HTML construct.

        
        - The gettext (localization) support now supports hooks, which can
          be used to utilize something other than gettext() to fetch the
          translated strings. A new parameter was added to the constructor of
          TemplateProcessor to accomplish this.

        - Character case of names of variables is not limited anymore.
          A lot of people asked for this particular change.
          You can name your variables and loops any way you like.

        - Template directives now can be written in lowercase.
          Again, a lot of people asked for this.
          For example, you can write: <tmpl_var name>

          Mixed case will never be supported though:
           
                for example <Tmpl_Var name> is incorrect

        - more liberal rules regarding which characters can be in name
          of a variable

        - optimization in normal (*.tmplc files) compiled templates:
            
            The processing tokens are no longer stored as strings
            in the bytecode. Each token now takes only one byte.

        - more data is now internally passed by references

        - improved and expanded test suite
        

    1.14 : 2002/07/01
        - WAP support => 
          the ESCAPE option of TMPL_VAR statements can now be set to "WAP". 
          Doing so will make the variable properly escaped for WML pages.
          HTML escaping is not sufficient for WML pages, because in WML
          the "$" character must be escaped as "$$" sequence.

        - the prepare() method of the TemplateManager now accepts a new 
          parameter - force_precompiled =>

          param force_precompiled: Only use precompiled templates.
          This parameter is useful when all your templates are precompiled
          and located in a read-only directory. If the compiled
          template cannot be found, an exception is raised. The engine 
          does not check whether the compiled template is uptodate. 

        - the set() method of TemplateProcessor now can be called with
          either one or two parameters.

          When it's called with two parameters, its behaviour is unchanged.
          
          When it's called with one parameter only, then the parameter must be
          an associative array.  The function loops over this array, uses keys
          of the array as names of variables and values of the array as values
          of the variables. This can be used for fast multiassignemnts.  The
          values itself may be associative arrays, in which case the assignment
          is a loop assignment.

        - the "URL" value of TMPL_VAR's ESCAPE parameter now performs not only
          URL escaping, but URL escaping + HTML escaping

        - TMPL_STATIC now also has the ESCAPE option, same as TMPL_VARs have
        - TMPL_STATIC content is now by default automatically HTML-escaped

    1.13 : 2002/01/08
        - new feature: TMPL_STATIC - static variables resolved at 
          template compile time. This works similar to the #define statement
          of the C preprocessor. You can use it to turn repetitive strings
          into some sort of small includes with no runtime performance penalty.
          Typical usage: define colors or font sizes and then change them
          in all your templates from one place. This is very useful if you
          can't use CSS for some reason. Please check the updated docs for
          more info and also for the new related watch_files() method.
