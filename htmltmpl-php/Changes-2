    1.95 (2.0 beta): 2002/12/01
          
        This is a beta release of htmltmpl 2. 
        The code still needs more testing.


        - NEW: htmltmpl.so Template Processor loadable PHP module
               written in C, which provides big speed improvements.
               
               It uses a new special bytecode format optimized for
               maximum performance (*.tmplcc files).

               It works only on UNIX, because it caches the bytecode
               in IPC shared memory. Therefore it does not need to reread
               the .tmplcc files on every request.

               On your production servers you don't need to include()
               the htmltmpl.php library at all, which results in another
               big speed improvement.
